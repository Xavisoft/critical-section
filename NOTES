- allow locks to have timeouts
	- get rejected if it waits for too long
	- get released if it locks for too long
- statistics showing which locks actually gets locked
- identify threads holding locks so that we can detect deadlocks
- allow passing more than one key so that we collect keys
- sort keys by alphabetical order if possible, this automatically avoids deadlocks
